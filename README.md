# Audiobook Builder (Internet Archive version)

## Description

The Internet Archive site offers a vast collection of free "old-time radio" shows, audiobooks, and lectures that can be downloaded. While you can listen to them on your web browser, it can be inconvenient if you want to listen to them on your mobile device. Typically, these shows are provided as individual .mp3 files, requiring you to download them all, create a playlist, and remember your last listened file and position.

To make this process easier, I developed Audiobook Builder. With this app, all you need is the name of a show or book, or a direct link on archive.org. It will download the .mp3 files for the book, re-encode them with the same bit rate, generate a list of chapters (which can be edited during the process), and ultimately create an audiobook in .m4b format.
