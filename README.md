# Audiobook Builder (Internet Archive version)

## Description
There are thousands of free “old-time radio” shows, audiobooks, and lectures, available for download from the Internet Archive site (for example  https://archive.org/details/oldtimeradio). You can listen to them right on your web browser but if you would like to listen to the shows on your mobile device it is not very convenient - in most cases, they are provided as a set of single .mp3 files. You have to download all the files to your mobile device, create a playlist, always remember the last file and position you have listened to.<br>

It would be much easier if there was a simple way to create an audiobook from a radio show or a book you like.<br>

That is why I developed Audiobook Builder. Using this app, all you need is a show or a book name or a direct link on archive.org. It will download the book .mp3 files, re-encode all of them with the same bit rate, produce a list of chapters (you can edit it in the middle of the process), and then it will create an audiobook in .m4b format.<br>
